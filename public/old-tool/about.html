                June 27th update: I first released this version of the tool in 2016. Since then, I have received
                a tremendous amount of thoughtful feedback as to how it could be improved. I have been hard at work
                building a more comprehensive toolkit for EMDR therapists to use with their clients. You can see the
                product of
                that work by <a href="../signup.html" class="link">clicking here</a>.

                The new project will not impact the availability of this tool and it will continue to be hosted at this

            <br />
            <div class="section-content" id='test3'>
                EMDR (Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy) is an exciting form of psychotherapy that has
                been gaining traction in recent years as a means of <a class="link" href="http://www.emdria.org/?2"
                    target="_blank">
                    treating victims of trauma</a>. It is widely revered for its non-intrusive nature and comparatively
                short response times. This treatment is fairly new, only emerging <a class="link"
                    href="http://www.emdrhap.org/content/what-is-emdr/" target="_blank">around 25 years ago</a>, but has
                seen widespread adoption by patients and
                therapists
                alike.

            <br />
            <div class="section-content" id='test4'>
                As mentioned above, EMDR is typically administered in cases in which the patient has undergone a form
                of trauma. However, it is not stricly limited to cases of trauma, and some success has been observed in
                patients whose primary medical dilemma is an anxiety or depressive disorder. EMDR is notable for its
                ability to effectively treat those suffering from

            <div class="tag pad-bottom-tag">How to Use</div>
            <br />
            <div class="section-content" id='test5'>
                First, it important to note that the most effective and safe means of administering the therapy is
                under the
                guidance of a professional who has experience in working with anxiety and trauma treatments. It is
                advisable to consult
                with a professional for several sessions before discussing the utilization of the therapy in an
                isolated setting.
            </div>

            <div class="section-content" id='test6'>
                In order to use this website, you must first select a color, speed, and duration of the square that
                will be utilized in the EMDR treatment.
                It is important to pick the fastest speed that you can manage without feeling overwhelmed. Once your
                session has begun, follow the square back and forth with your eyes while focusing on
                the primary stressor and your emotions surrounding it. From here, let your mind drift naturally to
                related topics, taking care to avoid being caught up on one issue
                for an extended period of time.
            </div>

            <div class="section-content" id='test7'>
                An important note is that in order for EMDR to be effective, you want to get a full range of motion
                with your eyes. Make sure that you use a screen that is large enough to allow for this (most phone
                screens won't do the job).
            </div>

            <div class="section-content" id='test8'>
                Once again, it is not recommended to attempt EMDR therapy without first discussing it with a qualified
                therapist.
            </div>

            <div class="tag pad-bottom-tag">Finding a Therapist</div>
            <br />
            <div class="section-content" id='test9'>
                If you are looking for people who specialize in this form of treatment, the EMDR International
                Association <a class="link" target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.emdria.org/search/custom.asp?id=2337">offers
                    a simple tool</a> to streamline this
                process. Because EMDR can often be an intense and personal therapy, it is essential to find someone
                that you feel comfortable confiding in. If an open line of communication
                cannot be established, the effectiveness of the therapy can suffer as a result.
            </div>

            <div class="tag pad-bottom-tag">Affording a Therapist</div>
            <br />
            <div class="section-content" id='test10'>
                While the cost of therapy may at first seem prohibitively expensive, it is important to realize that
                there exist several options for easing the financial burden that it has on your life.
                The first, and perhaps most important way
                to do this is to check with your insurance to see if therapy is covered under your program. It is
                important to get in direct contact with your insurance provider when determining this, as the specifics
                of different programs can be confusing (some programs may
                cover a "social worker" but not a therapist, for example).
            </div>

            <div class="section-content" id='test11'>
                Another solution is to research information regarding "training clinics" in your area. Generally
                located in larger universities, these training clinics often offer lower rates
                as a reflection of the fact that their psychologists are still in the process of being trained. While
                this may be off-putting to some, it is important to realize that the treatment being employed by those
                in training is closely monitored and regulated
                by a professional, thus ensuring a much higher standard of treatment then one might initially
                anticipate.
